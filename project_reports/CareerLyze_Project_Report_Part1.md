ABSTRACT

CareerLyze is a revolutionary AI-powered platform that transforms how job seekers
approach resume optimization. Using cutting-edge Google Gemini AI technology and
advanced Natural Language Processing, we provide comprehensive resume analysis that
helps users land their dream jobs.

The project is built using modern web technologies including Next.js 16 for the
frontend, React 19 for user interface, MongoDB Atlas for data storage, and Google
Gemini AI for intelligent resume analysis. The system features user authentication,
secure file upload, PDF processing, AI-powered analysis, and detailed reporting.

Key features include automated resume scoring, skill gap analysis, ATS optimization
recommendations, and personalized improvement suggestions. The system processes
resumes in PDF format, extracts text content, and provides detailed feedback on
various aspects including formatting, content quality, keyword optimization,
and overall presentation.

The project demonstrates the practical application of AI in recruitment technology
and provides a user-friendly solution for resume optimization. The system has
been tested extensively and shows promising results in helping users improve
their resume quality and job application success rates.

The platform includes comprehensive security features with JWT authentication,
password hashing, secure file handling, and data protection. The responsive design
ensures optimal user experience across all devices and screen sizes.
